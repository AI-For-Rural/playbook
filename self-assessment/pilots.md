# Self-Assessment Pilot list / Status
DHS DS has prototyped and piloted a self-assessment version of the USDS playbook, and is looking to expand the feedback loop in the government at large.  We would like to work with other USDSers to bring the self-assessments to their corresponding departments or agencies to conduct additional pilots and collect feedback to help improve it.

[Current Playbook Self-Assessment document to be uploaded soon - pending some updates]

### The current self-assessment attempts...
1. To arm each USDS Play with binary Y/N questions (for simple scoring)
2. Reasonable amount of questions acknowledging a realistic time investment (to increase likeiyhood of completion)
3. To be written in plain language (avoid confusion and remove ambiguity)
4. To provide additional data for oversight bodies about not just the current output but the process a program is using to execute against their goals
5. To provide a program with a clearer way to identify gaps in their resources and capabilities, and a North Star for product development or service design that is distinct from any conventional government "Full Operating Capacity" marker

### Desired feedback:
- Increase distortion resistance of questions
- Stress test the applicability of the self-assessment across departments and programs
- Build on the self-assessment output, beyond a score, to include action items to improve your standing
- Get genernal feedback to enhance the current USDS Playbook itself
